            Conwayâ€™s Game of Life (henceforth, Life) is based on a grid system.
            Every individual location on the grid can be understood as a cell.
            The game, or simulation, occurs over iterations, or generations.
            After a generation, a cell may change from living or dead based on
            how many living or dead neighbors it had in a previous iteration. A
            neighbor is any immediately adjacent spot on the grid (horizontal,
            vertical or diagonal). We can understand this more clearly with an
            example and a clear demonstration of the rules. You are welcome to
            read about Life has 4 simple rules: A living cell with less than two
            living neighbours dies. A living cell with two or three live
            neighbours lives. A living cell with more than three live neighbours
            dies. A dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live
            cell, as if by reproduction.
